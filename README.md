# Statistical-data-analysis-2
## Repo dedicated to Statistical data analysis 2 course
### Course description:
	
Advanced course in machine learning methods.

1. frequentist vs bayesian approach in statistical modeling

2. bayesian networks (probabilistic graphical models)

3. parameter inference in probabilistic graphical models with fully observed data

4. EM algorithm (parameter estimation in models with hidden variables)

5. Markov chains and Hidden Markov <odels, as examples of bayesian networks, parameter estimation and inference

6. Exact inference in graphical models (factor graphs, the sum product algorithm, Cluster trees, potentials, Message passing, Junction tree algorithm)

7. model selection, model evidence, learning model structure, tree models, general models, structural EM

8. Sampling (MCMC, Gibbs sampling)

optionally also includes

9. variational inference.

10. exploratory data analysis on example of single cell RNA seq data
